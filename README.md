This is a simple repo to get me started in using GitHub.

Hello,
I'm Placid. I like C++, Java, and perhaps JS, althought I don't have much experience with it. I'm confused about where I fit in in the field of CS, so I'd like to try many things. I love natural and computer languages, poetry, music, dancing, reading, listening, and so much more.
